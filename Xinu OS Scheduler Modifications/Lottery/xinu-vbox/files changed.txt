CT1:    ready.c         -> added the syscall print_ready_list()
        main.c          -> added testcases

CT2:    process.h       -> added runtime, turnaroundtime and num_ctxsw params
        clkinit.c       -> initialized ctr1000
        clock.h         -> added ctr1000 for global usage
        clkhandler.c    -> increments ctr1000 every ms
                        -> increment runtime for currpid
        resched.c       -> initialized runtime and turnaroundtime after ctxsw for ptnew
                        -> increment num_ctxsw
        kill.c          -> end turnaroundtime here

CT3     create.c        -> added create_user_process function

CT4     resched.c       -> added DEBUG_CTXSW directive

CT5     create.c        -> added burst_execution function

Lottery Scheduling:

process.h       -> added user_process flag and tickets
create.c        -> initialized user_process flag and tickets for create and create_user_process
kernel.h        -> added new qid userprocesslist for user processes and made QUANTUM = 10
initialize.c    -> initialized newqueue for userprocesslist
queue.h         -> updated NQENT for accomodating userprocesslist and defined syscall print_ready_list()

insert.c        -> added insert_to_user()
ready.c         -> instantiated userprocesslist and updated insert logic

resched.c       -> modified to support lottery scheduling

prototypes.h    -> all function declaration
